SUBJECT: GDPR Right to be forgotten

Dear Sir, Madam,

I would like to exercise my GDPR right to be forgotten. I am a data subject in the context of your service/website ..., registered under the email address/account ...

I confirm that (REMOVE CASES THAT DO NOT APPLY IN YOUR CLAIM):
* the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected/processed;
* I withdraw my consent and/or object to the processing. As far as I can see, there are no overriding legitimate interest to continue processing;
* the personal data was unlawfully processed or has to be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation; 
* the personal data is processed in relation to the offer of information society services to a child. 

I am unable to identify that your organization can reject my claim on either of the following counts:
* to exercise a right of freedom of expression and information;
* to comply with a legal obligation or for the performance of a task of public interest;
* for the exercise or defence of legal claims; or
* for purposes relating to public health, archiving in the public interest, scientific/historic research or statistics.

Please remove all of my data and provide me with evidence of the removal.

I truly hope that you have not disclosed my personal data to a third party. However, if you have done so, you must inform them about the erasure of personal data and forward this request to them, with me in CC.

with kindest regards,

Subject McData
