SUBJECT: GDPR Right to restrict processing

Dear Sir, Madam,

I would like to exercise my GDPR right to restrict processing. I am a data subject in the context of your service/website ..., registered under the email address/account ...

I am strongly convinced that (REMOVE CASES THAT DO NOT APPLY IN YOUR CLAIM):
* the data that you are processing about me is inaccurate
* I have already objected to the processing
* the processing you are doing is unlawful
* you no longer need the data

I truly hope that you have not disclosed my personal data to a third party. However, if you have done so, you must inform them about the restriction of processing and forward this request to them, with me in CC.

with kindest regards,

Subject McData
